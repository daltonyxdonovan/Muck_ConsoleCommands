# MUCK CONSOLE COMMANDS BY DALTONYX <3

Adds several console commands to muck, to increase max health, stamina, hunger, shield, give any item, spawn a totem to respawn friends, give yourself unlimited gold! disable mobs or bosses if you want an easy playthrough!
INVINCIBLE BUILDINGS! No more shall Lil' Dave ruin your wonderful towers! Floating bases if you want!

I am open to suggestions for commands, and have plenty of free time. Just drop a suggestion and I'll get working on it!

## Installation

To install this project, follow these steps:

1. Install bepinex to Muck (I use bepinex 6 from the github here: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) DOES NOT WORK WITH BEPINEX 5.4
2. Start the game at least once, to populate bepinex folders
3. Put this ConsoleCommands.DLL into "steamapps/common/Muck/BepInEx/Plugins" and start game!

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. When actually in game (not at the title screen!) press / to open the console
2. Type your command, /help or /list will start you off!
3. If using autocomplete, press 'tab' to complete your suggestion
4. Press / again to send the command. NOTE: ENTER DOES NOT WORK. Just use / to send. It was either patch several functions related to sending text, or just use the / command. Obviously, I chose the easier route haha.
